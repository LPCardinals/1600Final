# Assembling your PC

**Important Note**: It's very rare to find immidiately success your first time building a PC, and it will likely take trial and error. This is just a rough guide, and there's an endless supply of helpful videos out there to guide your through the process and troubleshoot. Happy building!

Step-by-step:

1. Installing the *CPU* in your *Motherboard*:
  <br> 
First, raise the small lever to the side of the motherboard socket until it forms a 90 degree angle with the socket. Most CPU chips will have an arrow on one corner that alligns with a similar marking on the motherboard socket, make sure these are alligned then gently install the CPU.
   
2. Installing the *RAM* in your *Motherboard*:
  <br>  
First, pull the plastic tabs on both ends of each RAM slot away from eachother. The slots are usually found towards the top right of the board. Your RAM stick will have a small slot cut out that will line up with a divider inside the slot. Once lined up, push your sticks in firmly but gently until you hear the plastic tabs from earlier click into place.
   
3. Mounting the *Motherboard* to your *Case*:
  <br> 
Your case should come with instructions and set screws for mounting your motherboard to the case. Every case and motherboard setup is different, so it's important to consult those instructions.
   
4. Mounting the *CPU Cooler* to your *CPU*:
  <br> 
The process here will depend on the type of cooler you chose in your parts list, but for most applications your cooler will come with different bracket styles to support various CPU sockets. Use the bracket type that corresponds with your motherboard socket and follow the instructions. Also, if your cooler does not have pre-applied thermal paste, apply a pea sized drop to the center of the CPU.
   
5. Installing the *GPU* to your *Motherboard*:
  <br> 
On the lower half of your motherboard you'll find your PCI Express slot, usually the first one. It's once again important to note that every case is different but typically there will be a back plate on the back of your case with expansion slots. If this is the case, you'll first unscrew the expansion slots where your card will be going. Then, pull back the tab on your PCI Express slot, and similar to your RAM sticks gently push your video card into the slot until you hear a click. Then use the screws from the back of the case to secure the card to the back of the case.

6. Installing your *Storage Drives*
  <br> 
Your case will typically come with a drive cage or something similar for you to store your hard drives. Solid states drives are often mounted to the back using screws, but consult your case manual for proper location. Your can also go ahead and plug in the SATA cables that should've come with your motherboard.
    
7. Installing your *Power Supply* in the *Case*, and plugging in your cables:
  <br> 
Locations for power supplies vary from case to case, so consult your manual. Once you've installed the power supply, you'll need to make sure all of your connections are made to your motherboard including 20/24 pin power cable, 4/8 pin CPU power connector, 6/8 pin GPU power connector (if applicable), SATA power for your drives, etc. Additionally, your case should come with cables for your power and reset buttons and and fans if they were inscluded that all plug into your motherboard.
    
8. Installing your *Wi-Fi Card* (if applicable):
  <br> 
Many modern motherboards come with integrated wi-fi, however if yours does not then you can install a wif-fi card which installs almost the same as your GPU, and typically installs in the smallest PCI slot below your GPU.
    
9. Mounting supplementary *Case Fans*:
  <br> 
Should your case come with support for additional fans, take advantage of better cooling and airflow. Just be sure your motherbord can support additional fans first.
    
10. Cable Management!

11. Booting and installing your *Operating System*:
  <br> 
The easiest way to set up your OS is to use a USB flashdrive and a seperate computer. On that seperate computer, download and install of your preferred operating system (usually Windows or Linux), then plug the drive into your new computer, load into BIOs using the onscreen instructions, and boot from your flash drive to set up your OS!
